# GenerateTemplate



## Installation

This is intended as a command-line application, so install as:

    $ gem install generate_template

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run 
`rake spec` to run the tests and `bundle exec rubocop` to lint the code. You can 
also run `guard` during development, which will run linting and tests on any 
file after it is saved.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To 
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run 
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push 
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to 
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
